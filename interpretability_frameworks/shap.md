# SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)

SHAP is an open-source library that provides a unified measure of feature importance for any machine learning model. It is based on the concept of Shapley values, a cooperative game theory technique used to determine the contribution of each player to the game.

## Overview

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is a game theoretic approach to explain the output of any machine learning model. It connects optimal credit allocation with local explanations using the classic Shapley values from game theory and their related extensions.

## Features

- **Unified Measure:** SHAP provides a unified measure of feature importance that applies to any model.
- **Local Explanation:** SHAP provides local model interpretation, meaning it explains individual predictions.
- **Global Interpretability:** SHAP also provides a global view of feature importance and effects.

## Installation

You can install SHAP using pip:

```bash
pip install shap
```

## Usage

Here is a basic example of using SHAP to explain predictions:

```python
import shap

# Initialize your model
model = ...

# Initialize a SHAP explainer
explainer = shap.Explainer(model)

# Calculate Shap values
shap_values = explainer.shap_values(X)

# Plot the SHAP values
shap.summary_plot(shap_values, X)
```
