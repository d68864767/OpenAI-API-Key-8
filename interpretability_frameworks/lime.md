# Lime (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations)

Lime is an open-source library that allows you to explain the predictions of any machine learning classifier. It is model-agnostic, meaning it can be used with any machine learning model, and it is capable of handling both tabular data and text data.

## Overview

Lime (Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) is a project from the University of Washington that provides an intuitive explanation of the predictions of any machine learning model. Lime is based on the idea that a good way to explain the prediction of any machine learning model is by approximating it locally with an interpretable model.

## Features

- **Model Agnostic:** Lime is model-agnostic, meaning it can be used with any machine learning model.
- **Local Explanation:** Lime provides local model interpretation, meaning it explains individual predictions.
- **Interpretable Inputs:** Lime represents interpretable inputs as binary vectors that select a subset of features in the original instance, thus allowing for explanations in the same input space as the original data.

## Installation

You can install Lime using pip:

```bash
pip install lime
```

## Usage

Here is a basic example of using Lime to explain predictions:

```python
import lime
from lime import lime_tabular

# Initialize LimeTabularExplainer
explainer = lime_tabular.LimeTabularExplainer(training_data)

# Explain a prediction
exp = explainer.explain_instance(test_instance, model.predict_proba)

# Display the explanation
exp.show_in_notebook()
```
