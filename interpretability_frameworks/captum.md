# Captum

Captum is an open-source library developed by Facebook for model interpretability and understanding. It provides a suite of attribution algorithms that allow us to understand the importance of input features and how they contribute to the predictions of a model.

## Overview

Captum, which is Latin for comprehension, provides a set of algorithms known as attribution methods that allow us to understand the importance of input features, and how they contribute to the predictions of a model. It is designed to work with any PyTorch model, and it provides implementations of a wide variety of attribution algorithms, including Integrated Gradients, DeepLIFT, and Guided Backpropagation.

## Features

- **Model Agnostic:** Captum can be used with any PyTorch model.
- **Comprehensive:** Captum provides a wide variety of attribution algorithms, including Integrated Gradients, DeepLIFT, and Guided Backpropagation.
- **Flexible:** Captum allows for custom attribution methods and provides advanced features for researchers.

## Installation

You can install Captum using pip:

```bash
pip install captum
```

## Usage

Here is a basic example of using Captum to explain predictions:

```python
import torch
from captum.attr import IntegratedGradients
from captum.attr import visualization as viz

# Initialize your model
model = ...

# Initialize Integrated Gradients
ig = IntegratedGradients(model)

# Calculate attribute
attr = ig.attribute(input, target=label_index)

# Visualize the attribute
viz.visualize_image_attr(attr)
```
