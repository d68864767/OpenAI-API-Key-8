# Themis

Themis is an open-source fairness assessment toolkit that allows developers to evaluate their machine learning models for fairness. It provides a simple and intuitive API to assess the fairness of machine learning models based on various fairness definitions and under different conditions.

## Features

- **Fairness Metrics**: Provides a comprehensive set of fairness metrics which are easy to understand and implement.
- **Bias Detection**: Helps in detecting any bias in the model towards any particular feature.
- **Visualizations**: Provides visualizations to help understand the bias in the models.

## Installation

You can install Themis using pip:

```bash
pip install themis-ml
```

## Usage

Here is a basic usage example:

```python
from themis_ml import fairness as fm
from themis_ml.metrics import mean_difference

# Load your data
# data = ...

# Define the target and protected attributes
target = 'target_attribute'
protected_attr = 'protected_attribute'

# Compute fairness metrics
fairness_metrics = fm.FairnessMetrics(target, protected_attr)
results = fairness_metrics.compute(data, mean_difference)

# Print the results
print(results)
```

For more detailed usage and examples, please refer to the [official Themis documentation](http://themis-ml.readthedocs.io/).
